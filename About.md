# The religion of Gaia

The religion of Gaia is based on the idea that the earth is the source of our existence, and that we need to take care of it in order to preserve our own lives. 

This religion was started after thinking about how different religions use their resources, and I realized that these resources could for better be used to take care of our earth. Gaia was born from this realization.

So, what is the religion of Gaia? The religion of Gaia is a way of life that honors the earth as our source of existence. We believe that the earth is the life source, and we need to take care of it. We also believe that all our actions should be based on non-violence, and to achieve our goals we have to be able to enter the mental state called flow.

None of the members of Gaia will have rights to any of Gaia's money. Any resources or support Gaia will get from members or governmental institutions will be used to achieve the goals of Gaia, which is to to make a sustainable way of life.

All resources of Gaia will be given to projects that help make a sustainable way of living for us. This includes projects that clean up plastic from the ocean, saving the rain-forest and other ways to take care of our planet.  The members will decide which project is worth supporting.

## Non-violence
###  What is non-violence

Non-violence goes beyond refraining from physical violence and includes avoiding emotional, verbal, and environmental violence as well. Violence does not just mean hitting or shooting someone. It also means not putting people down with words or making others feel less than what they are worth. Violence is, for example, judging other people based on your moral values. It is telling them they are doing it wrong and that you are right. Instead, you should explain that whatever they are doing is not meeting your needs, and because you have certain needs, you would like things to be differently. This way any request you have for change, is not based on moral judgments but on needs. 

I would recommend reading the book Non-violent communication by Marshal Rosenberg for more information about this. 
### Why non-violence

As a religious society, we consist of a group of people, and we are vulnerable to group-think. The problem with group-think is that it leads to extreme actions. One guy might say something like "I take my responsibility so seriously that I am going to do X". Another guy then builds on that, and follows up by saying something more extreme like "I can see you have good intentions, but my intentions are even better because I will do Y". This process of one-upping can lead to disastrous and violent results. You can see this happening in many religions. So to prevent disasters, Gaia must be based in non-violence. 
## Flow

Since we have already made such a mess with polluting our planet, we need to work hard to correct our mistakes. For this work to be fruitful and not lead to burnout and misery, we must strive for the mental state called flow.  

### What is flow

Flow is a mental state in which a person is fully immersed in what they are doing. This state is characterized by a feeling of effortlessness and pleasure. When we are in flow, we are completely focused on the task at hand and we lose sense of time. We become one with what we are doing. 

Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi is a psychologist who has done extensive research on the flow state. He has identified some conditions that need to be met in order for someone to enter the flow state. The first condition is that the task at hand has to matche to our skills. If the task is too easy, we will get bored, and if it is too hard we get frustrated, and fall out of flow. Scientists have discovered 22 conditions that can lead to flow. These conditions are called flow triggers.  

Flow is not a new thing. For example, Friedrich Nietzsche wrote a similar state (or the same state) that he called "rausch" which he defined as “the great stimulus to life. ” He saw this state as the key to creativity and genius.

### Why flow

Research into the flow state has shown that people who experience the most flow in their lives, are also the happiest. So if we want to be happy, we should strive to live in a way that allows us to enter the flow state as often as possible.

The flow state is also important for another reason. When we are in flow, we are more productive, and we produce better results. Therefore, if we hope to achieve something, we must learn how to enter the flow state. And what we would like to achieve is a sustainable and thriving world for all.

A search on google for "22 flow triggers" will give you a lot of more information bout flow.

## Missionary work

Missionary work is controversial because many people feel that some stranger invade their private life, and a force a moral belief system upon them. 

The religion of Gaia is based in non-violence. So unlike other religious missionaries, we will not force our beliefs onto others, but will instead explain our need for taking care of our planet, and how what little you can do to help. 

### Why missonary

The reason we need to do missionary work is that the state of our planet is dire, and we need as many people as possible to help us turn things.

## Summary

The religion of Gaia is based on three pillars; Taking care of our planet, non-violence and flow. These pillars are important because they allow us to create a sustainable and thriving world for all.

It is not relevant whether you believe in global warming or not, taking care of our planet is still something that we should all do. Local pollution like plastic in the ocean has to be cleaned up, or it will eventually end all life.
